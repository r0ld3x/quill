# Quill - A Modern Fullstack SaaS-Platform

## ⚠️ **Project Status: Pending Due to Insufficient Resources**

Unfortunately, this project is currently on hold due to limited resources. The main challenge is that the project **requires a ChatGPT API** key, which we currently don't have access to. We are actively seeking support and resources to obtain the required API key and resume development. Your understanding and patience are greatly appreciated.

If you're interested in contributing, providing resources, or supporting this project, please contact us or check for updates on our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/r0ld3x/quill).

Thank you for your understanding!
